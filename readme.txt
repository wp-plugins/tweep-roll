Tweep Roll is like Blogroll, for your Twitter friends.

== Description ==
When I find a Tweep (a Twitter friend) that tweets about interesting things, I’m always interested to see who they are following. So I have created a Wordpress plugin called “Tweep Roll” which is like Blogroll, but shows a list of your Twitter friends instead. So if someone reads your blog and finds you interesting, they may want to follow whoever you are following.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `tweep-roll-vX.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and extract
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the widget to your sidebar through the 'Appearance'->'Widgets' section.
4. Enter the title for the Tweep Roll, your Twitter username and the number of Tweeps to show.


== Screenshots ==

1. The 'Appearance'->'Widgets' section in Wordpress. Fill in the relevent values.
